A small test of the behavior of a MAC (Multiply-Adder) using SystemC language.


Includes a Makefile and source files.

This is designed to run on Linux (64 bit) and requires a SystemC install.
When running the executable will produce a .vhd file, which can open in programs like GTKviewer to examine the traces of the signals.
